          <section class="content"><p>I read <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/13/this-french-tech-school-has-no-teachers-no-books-no-tuition-and-it-could-change-everything/">an interesting article</a> about École 42. It may be a bit silly to compare this 70-million-euro-venture to our teeny weeny organisation, but I like to do silly things at times. There are a lot of similarities between their approach and what we plan to do at <a href="http://she.codes/">she.codes</a>, and one key difference.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>First the similarities: There are no teachers. Instead of transferring knowledge from one person to a group of pupils, the students use the Internet and their peers. Knowledge flows in all directions. Groups of students work on projects together and gather hands-on experience in what it is like to deliver a product. Both approaches emphasise collaboration and peer support. We share the funding model too: both schools count on donations as a primary source of funding. Both schools are free for students&nbsp;initially.</p>
<p>While École 42 can afford the to have no business model at all (their founder is incredibly rich), we’ll probably need additional ways of generating income (other than donations)  to keep the servers running. At the same time, we are dedicated to keep the barrier to entrance as low as possible. Our entry-level courses therefor will always be free and they will take students to a level where they are able to earn money with the skills they acquired. We will then offer advanced courses for a small fee, to get them into higher income levels. That way, we hope, our income roughly will  be proportional to our&nbsp;costs.</p>
<p>There is another, more important difference: École 42 is located in a physical building in Paris, and their students are being equiped with hardware and live and learn on campus. Therefore, the number of students they can accept is limited. Because of the huge demand, École 42’s acceptance rate is even lower than those of elite universities like Harvard or Stanford, and applicants have to pass hardcore tests in order to be accepted. As a consequence, only students that already have a strong backround in computing make it into École&nbsp;42.</p>
<p>At she.codes however, our mission is to bring as many women into the software industry as we can, including those with little or no prior exposure to programming. Because we do not have physical restrictions, we will be able to accept any number of&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>A virtual learning environment cannot deliver the ‘human touch’ of sharing a physical space with all the other students, but it has unique advantages as well. Our platform’s matchmaking feature selects students with similar skill levels for a remote pair programming session. The flow of knowledge between two persons is more effective when they are not intimidated by the other one’s superiority. The result of this collaboration then is reviewed by more experienced students who have a broader understanding and the original team can take their project to the next&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>The larger the pool of students is, the better this will work. While École 42 has to set hard milits on how many students they can accept and therefor has to filter out everyone but the most experiened and talented appicants, she.codes’ community benefits from each and every new student. Only this way, we can stay true to our&nbsp;mission.</p>
<p>Nicolas Sadirac, École 42’s director, mentions that prestigious universities already expressed interest in the school’s approach. But what will universities provide if students take their knowledge from the Internet, work on their own project ideas and learn from each other rather than from teachers? I can’t think of much more than the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
<p>The fact that many of today’s most successful software developers do not have academic degrees shows that universities fail to deliver what the industry demands for quite a while now. Technology and also methodology change too fast, we cannot expect teachers that ended their education a decade ago to successfully deliver to students what is relevant to the industry today. We need peer-to-peer learning and we need models that scale and that are inclusive instead of&nbsp;elite.</p>
<p>And classrooms? We can do without&nbsp;them.</p>
