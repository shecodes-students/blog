          <section class="content"><p>I read <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/13/this-french-tech-school-has-no-teachers-no-books-no-tuition-and-it-could-change-everything/">an interesting article</a> about École 42. It may be a bit silly to compare this 70 million euro venture to our teeny weeny organisation, but I like to do silly things at times. There are a lot of similarities between their approach and what we plan to do at <a href="http://she.codes/">she.codes</a>, and some key differences.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p> There are no teachers. Instead of transferring knowledge from one person to a group of pupils, the students use the Internet and their peers. Knowledge flows in all directions. Groups of students work on projects together and gather hands-on experience in what it is like to deliver a product. Both approaches emphasise collaboration and peer support. We share the funding model too: both schools count on donations as a primary source of funding. Both schools are free for&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>However, there is one important difference: École 42 is located in a physical building, and their students are being equiped with hardware and live and learn on campus. Therefore, the number of students they can accept is limited. Because of their huge demand, École 42’s acceptance rate is even lower than those of elite universities like Harvard or Stanford, and applicants have to pass hardcore tests in order to be accepted. As a consequence, only students that already have a strong backround in computing make it into École&nbsp;42.</p>
<p>At she.codes however, our mission is to bring as many women into the software industry as we can, including those with little or no prior exposure to programming. Because we do not have physical restrictions, we will be able to accept any number of students. Our platform’s matchmaking feature selects students with similar skill levels for a remote pair programming session. The larger the pool of students is, the better this will&nbsp;work.</p>
<p> Nicolas Sadirac, École 42’s director, mentions that prestigious universities already expressed interest in the school’s  approach. But what will they provide in this project-driven, teacherless peer-to-peer learning scenario? I can’t think of much more than the class room. The fact that many of today’s most successful software developers do not have academic degrees  shows that universities fail to deliver what the industry demands for quite a while now. Classrooms? Not sure if we need them at&nbsp;all!</p>
