        <section class="content"><p>Our mission is to teach programming to women of all backgrounds, incuding those with little or no prior exposure to the field of software development and the inner workings of operating systems or&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>The Internet offers a rich variety of learning resources like screencasts, blog articles, recordings of conference talks and  educational games. Universities started to open up their educational resources to the public, the idea of open licenses is spreading from software to the educational&nbsp;sector.</p>
<p>It was never easier to teach yourself how to program, and it never made more sense economically, the software idustry is getting more and more desperate for new talents and has a lot to offer to those who own the right set of skills. There’s just one problem.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>There is no lack of resources, all the knowledge is out there, ready to be consumed, but finding the right ones, the ones produced by talented didacts can be a frustrating task. And even with a curated list of the best resources, finding those that do not require too much prior knowledge, yet do not presume too little, is hard and&nbsp;time-consuming.</p>
<p>Students need a guide that points them to the resources that are the most relevant to them individually, taking into account what they already know and what knowledge they need to acquire to get to the next&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>Curating is part of the solution, but we need&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>In order to have a fun and successful learning experience, a student has to have some knowledge prior to consuming a certain piece of information. She has to be familiar with certain terms and concepts that are provided by other resources, which therefore should be consumed first. In Computer Science such a structure of things that depend on each other is called a <em>dependency graph</em>. Unfortunately, videos on youtube and tutorials on blogs typically describe these requirements in very broad terms, like ‘for beginners’ or ‘for an advanced audience’, but the problem is much more complicated, the dependencies are fine grained, and given that little information, we inadvertently end up consuming material that we are not ready for, which is not the most efficient use of our&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The good news is: A very similar problem already has been solved. If you think about it, installing new software onto a computer system has a lot in common with a human learning about new concepts. There are prerequisites in both cases, conditions that must be met in order to add new stuff on&nbsp;top.</p>
<p> If you install an email server onto a Unix system for example, that piece of software provides something to the computer as a whole (the ability to send and receive emails), but in order to be installed, it needs some other pieces of software to be installed first. These dependencies for example are software libraries that do network communications and handle cryptography or various character encodings. All of these libraries must pre-exist in order for the system to be able to accept the new piece, much like a human that needs to know about the latin alphabet as well as arabic numbers and some basic math in order to understand hexadecimal&nbsp;notation.</p>
<p>In the world of computer systems, this problem is solved by packaging software with information needed to successfully install it onto a system. That information, the <em>meta data</em>, is not part of the software itself, instead it talks about it, it describes what the software adds to the system and what the software expects the system to provide prior to being installed (certain software libraries). These libraries in turn themselves are packaged up with their meta data and declare what they need. It is not uncommon to have very deeply nested dependency graphs that involve hundreds of&nbsp;packages.</p>
<p>Figuring out in what order to install all these packages is a complicated problem, but it is the kind of problem that computers are very good at. A <em>package manager</em> is the tool that resolves all these dependencies and that finally comes up with a plan to add the desired ability to the system by figuring out exactly where to download every bit and piece and by determining the exact order to put them on the system so that in the end, no dependency remains&nbsp;unresolved.</p>
<p>It is not hard to replace ‘computer’ by ‘human’ and ‘software package’ by ‘education resource’. It is funny that we humans came up with a sophisticated way to add new abilities to machines, yet when it comes to do the same for ourselves, we pretty much do the same as a thousand years ago. Let’s fix&nbsp;that!</p>
<p>A couple of days ago on the Open Knowledge Festival 2014 in Berlin, I was lucky enough to run into <a href="http://boazsender.com/">Boaz Sender</a>, <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Bocoup, a company with the mission “to move the Open Web forward through education”. Like us, they are thinking about a common format for Open Education Resources (OER) and have a strong focus on modern web technologies. A shared, open data format for learning resources would enable us to add the missing meta data to existing resources, turn unstructured learning material into well-defined educational packages that declare their dependencies and announce what they provide in machine-readable form. With this meta-data stored in an open database, maintained by the community, we would be able to implement <em>the package manager for the brain</em>, a tool that not only can assemble reading lists that take a student from her individual learning stage to whereever she wants to go, choosing the most efficient path for her, it also will be able to predict frustration points in manually assembled curricula, it will find gaps, concepts that are used that never were introduced, it will serve as a debugging tool for learning&nbsp;programs.</p>
<p>We figured out an efficient way to teach our machines new tricks decades ago. Now it is time to make these ideas accessible for education to help humans to navigate the vast universe of free and open education resources and learn more&nbsp;effectively.</p>
