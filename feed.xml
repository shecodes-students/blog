      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kathrinpassig&quot;&gt;Kathrin Passig&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/13/this-french-tech-school-has-no-teachers-no-books-no-tuition-and-it-could-change-everything/&quot;&gt;article about École 42&lt;/a&gt;. It may be a bit silly to compare this 70-million-euro venture to our teeny weeny organisation, but I like to do silly things at times. There are a lot of similarities between their approach and what we plan to do at &lt;a href=&quot;http://she.codes/&quot;&gt;she.codes&lt;/a&gt;, and one key difference.
&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First the similarities: There are no teachers. Instead of transferring knowledge from one person to a group of pupils, the students use the Internet and their peers. Knowledge flows in all directions. Groups of students work on projects together and gather hands-on experience in what it is like to deliver a product. Both approaches emphasise collaboration and peer support. We share the funding model too: both schools count on donations as a primary source of funding, and both schools are free for students initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While École 42 can afford to have no business model at all (their founder is incredibly rich), we’ll probably need additional ways of generating income (other than donations)  to keep the servers running. At the same time, we are dedicated to keeping the barrier to entrance as low as possible. Our entry-level courses will therefore always be free, and they will take students to a level where they are able to earn money with the skills they acquired. We will then offer advanced courses for a small fee to get them into higher income levels. That way, we hope, our income will be roughly proportional to our costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another, more important, difference - École 42 is located in a physical building in Paris, their students are being equipped with hardware, and they live and learn on campus. Therefore, the number of students they can accept is limited. Because of the huge demand, École 42’s acceptance rate is even lower than those of elite universities like Harvard or Stanford, and applicants have to pass hardcore tests in order to be accepted. As a consequence, only students that already have a strong backround in computing make it into École 42.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At she.codes however, our mission is to bring as many women into the software industry as we can, including those with little or no prior exposure to programming. Because we do not have physical restrictions, we will be able to accept any number of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual learning environment cannot deliver the ‘human touch’ of sharing a physical space with all the other students, but it has unique advantages as well. Our platform’s matchmaking feature selects students with similar skill levels for a remote pair programming session. The flow of knowledge between two persons is more effective when they are not intimidated by the other one’s superiority. The result of this collaboration is then reviewed by more experienced students who have a broader understanding and the original team can take their project to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger the pool of students is, the better this will work. While École 42 has to set hard limits on how many students they can accept, and thusly has to filter out all but the most experiened and talented appicants, the she.codes’ community benefits from each and every new student. Only through this can we stay true to our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Sadirac, École 42’s director, mentions that prestigious universities have already expressed interest in the school’s approach, but what will universities provide if students take their knowledge from the Internet, work on their own project ideas, and learn from each other rather than from teachers? I can’t think of much more than the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of today’s most successful software developers are self-taught and do not have academic degrees. Universities struggle to deliver what the industry demands for quite a while now. Technology and methodology change too fast - we cannot expect teachers that ended their education decades ago to successfully deliver to students what is relevant to the software industry today. We need peer-to-peer learning and we need models that scale and that are inclusive instead of elitist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And classrooms? We can do without them.&lt;/p&gt;
