JavaScript is an exteremly versatile language and our language of choice when it comes to teaching programming. Euorpe's JavaScript enthusiasts meet each year at JSConfEU in Berlin. It is the best event on the continent to learn about new developments and to celebrate  great parties with the community.

JSConfEU's organizers always have been very commited to work towards better gender parity among speakers at their events. Due to its vast popularity, conference tickets are being sold out within minites after releasing a new block. This unfortunately works against diversity among attendees. This year JSConfEU asked she.codes to help with making more tickets available to women and assigned us an exclusive block of tickets!
