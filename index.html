        <section class="content"><p>Our mission is to teach programming to women of all backgrounds, incuding those with little or no prior exposure to the field of software development and the inner workings of operating systems or&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>The Internet offers a rich variety of learning resources like screencasts, blog articles, recordings of conference talks and  educational games. Universities started to open up their educational resources to the public, the idea of open licenses is spreading from software to the educational&nbsp;sector.</p>
<p>It was never easier to teach yourself how to program, snd it never made more sense economically, the software idustry is getting more and more desperate for new talents and has a lot to offer to those who own the right set of skills. There’s just one&nbsp;problem.

          <h2><a href="/blog/articles/jsconfeu2014/">she.coders get exclusive tickets for JSConfEU 2014!</a></h2>
        </header>
        <section class="content"><p>JavaScript is an extremely versatile language, and it is our language of choice when it comes to teaching programming. Europe’s JavaScript enthusiasts meet each year at JSConfEU in Berlin. It is the <a href="http://2014.jsconf.eu/why/">best event on the continent</a> to learn about new developments and to celebrate  great parties with the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>JSConfEU’s organizers have always been very committed to working towards better gender parity among speakers at their events. Due to its vast popularity, conference tickets are being sold out within minutes after releasing a new block. This unfortunately works against diversity among&nbsp;attendees. </p>
<p>This year, the organisers of JSConfEU are working even harder to promote diversity in technology, and they have extended a special invitation to she.codes to help with making more tickets available to women by assigning us an exclusive block of&nbsp;tickets!

        <section class="content"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kathrinpassig">Kathrin Passig</a> pointed me to an interesting <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/13/this-french-tech-school-has-no-teachers-no-books-no-tuition-and-it-could-change-everything/">article about École 42</a>. It may be a bit silly to compare this 70-million-euro venture to our teeny weeny organisation, but I like to do silly things at times. There are a lot of similarities between their approach and what we plan to do at <a href="http://she.codes/">she.codes</a>, and one key&nbsp;difference.
